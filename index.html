    <p style="color: white;">“I’m Taylor Swift and I was born in 1989!”
        Whether she's breaking records or breaking Ticketmaster, Taylor Swift has proven time and again that she's one of the most powerful figures in modern music.</p>
        
    <p style="color: white;">We first realized how captivating Swift was during the release of her 6th studio album, ‘reputation’. A revenge album and one of the boldest comebacks in the history of pop culture, she cemented herself as an inspiration in our hearts.
        “There will be no explanation, there will just be reputation”.</p>
    <p style="color: white;">During the pandemic, Taylor Swift released her first Alternative/Indie surprise album which made us completely fall in love with her songwriting and storytelling. From talking about her own internal struggles to myths, we related to all of it.
        Her versatility can be seen through the genres of her albums. It ranges from country to pop to indie and even some surprise rock performances during her tours.</p>
        
    <p style="color: white;">Having hit its one year anniversary, the Eras Tour  has established itself as one of the most legendary tours of all time. It was making headlines before it even began. </p>
        
    <p style="color: white;"> It is Swifts’s sixth concert tour spanning across five continents, consisting of 152 shows including stops in Japan, Australia, Singapore, France, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Poland and Austria, as well as the United Kingdom. This tour celebrates Taylor’s 17-year long career by having a setlist of 44 songs from all 10 albums from Debut to Midnights. She has an uncredible stamina which lets her perform continuously for 3 and a half hours for two to three days. </p>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Let’s go one era at a time:</h3>
    <p style="color: black; background-color: plum;">Lover: Swift opens the Eras Tour with “It’s been a long time coming…”, a lyric from the song ‘Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince”, then goes into her hit single ‘Cruel Summer’. She then dives into more of the popular songs like ‘You Need to Calm Down’, feminist anthem‘The Man’, an anxious ballad ‘The Archer’ and every romantic's favorite tune ‘Lover’. </p>
    <p style="color: black; background-color: goldenrod;">Fearless: She starts this era with some of the iconic 2009 hit singles; ‘You Belong With Me’, ‘Fearless’ and ‘Love Story’.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white; background-color: saddlebrown;"> Evermore: This era begins with a mystical witch act where the performers dance around with spheres of light for the song ‘willow’ which is then followed with ‘marjorie’ where everyone pays tribute to Swift's grandmother by holding up their phone flashlights, ‘champagne problems’ where everyone screams their heart out to the bridge and ‘tolerate it’, a theatrical as well as heartbreaking performance by Swift.</p>
    <p style="color: white; background-color: black;">Reputation: This era has one of the boldest entrances made by a snake glitching around the stage. It opened with ‘..Ready for It?’, ‘Delicate’ and included a transition from ‘Don’t Blame Me’ to ‘Look What You Made Me Do’.</p>
    <p style="color: white; background-color: mediumslateblue;">Speak Now: This era is one of the more shortlived ones but one of the most magical ones as well. It consists of two songs, ‘Enchanted’ which transports you to a fairytale and ‘Long Live’ where Swift sings about her relationship between herself and the fans.</p>
    <p style="color: white; background-color: maroon;">Red: It opens with an iconic birthday banger ‘22’ and then goes into, one of everyone’s favorite breakup anthems ‘We Are Never Getting Back Together’ and ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’. Then she closes the era with an acoustic performance with one of the most awaited songs of the night, ‘All Too Well (10 Minutes Version)’.</p>
    <p style="color: white; background-color: gray;">Folklore: This era takes us back to Swift’s cabin in the woods with ‘the 1’ and then goes into the famous love triangle songs, ‘cardigan’,’august’ and ‘betty’. Then she dives into the life of Rebekah Harkness with ‘the last great american dynasty’. Then she closes with an emotional ballads, ‘illicit affairs’ and ‘my tears ricochet’.</p>
    <p style="color: black;background-color: skyblue;">1989: This era brings back to Swift’s biggest hits, ‘Blank Space’, ‘Shake it Off’, ‘Style’ , ‘Wildest Dreams’ and ‘Bad Blood’.
    </p>
    <p style="color: black; background-color:blanchedalmond;">Surprise Songs: This section is one of the most exciting as the surprise songs are different for each show. Sometimes she also performs mashups of two or more songs.
    </p>
    <p style="color: white; background-color: darkslateblue"> Midnights: Literally diving into her last era with lavender clouds all over, she opens with ‘Lavender Haze’, then moves onto everyone’s self-deprecating anthem ‘Anti-Hero’. She then performs ‘Vigilante Shit’, ‘Bejeweled’, ‘Mastermind’, ‘Midnight Rain’ and ends the magical night with her latest bop ‘Karma’.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;color:white;font-style: italic">ERAS TOUR (Taylor's Version)- The Movie</h1>
    <p style="color: white;">During the tour, Taylor Swift filmed a tour documentary of the Eras Tour. The filming took place in August 2023 at three shows at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, in a budget of $10–20 million, with SAG-AFTRA permitting production to proceed amidst its 2023 strike. She had even reportedly withheld negotiations with streamers, for her concert movie until the SAG strike got resolved. The film's unorthodox release strategy generated much commentary from film, music, and entertainment journalists. 
        Vanity Fair opined that the film arrived "just when movie going needs it most" and may boost theater earnings after the business was widely affected. Many journalists expressed similar sentiments, believing the film would "save" the late 2023 box office.  National Association of Theatre Owners president Michael O'Leary believed the success of The Eras Tour indicates the potential of concert films in theaters. The Daily Telegraph praised Swift as "the greatest tactician in showbusiness," writing, "Barbenheimer showed people will go to the cinema if they feel they are participating in a communal experience. Hollywood refused to take advantage of this. So Swift has instead." <br><br>
        
        Analyses from Collider and TheWrap concluded that by successfully negotiating her deal and proving its profitability, Swift incentivized theaters to find programming without the help of the studios, "potentially changing the dynamics of cinema distribution." British-American filmmaker Christopher Nolan supported her "unorthodox release model" and claimed concert films are the future of moviegoing.Tony Vinciquerra, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures, called The Eras Tour a "massive, unexpected rescue" for theaters. Variety opined that the film saved the fall movie season.
        
        On September 1, 2023, AMC announced that The Eras Tour had grossed $26 million within three hours on its platform, marking the highest-ever single-day advance ticket sales in the company's history, surpassing the previous record of $16.9 million by Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). 
        Wanda Gierhart Fearing, chief marketing officer of Cinemark, reported they had booked an "unprecedented number of auditoriums" to meet demand. 
        <br><br>It is the highest grossing concert or performance film of all time, a feat recognized in the 2023 Guinness World Records. 
        The website's consensus reads: "Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour delivers exactly what it promises: A smoothly directed, impeccably performed documentary capturing the concert event of the year."Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 83 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating "universal acclaim". 
        It was the best reviewed musical movie of 2023, as per Rotten Tomatoes. </p>
        <br>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;color:white;font-style: italic;">Impact of the Eras Tour</h1>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Economic Impact :</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
        The Eras Tour is projected to generate close to $5 billion in consumer spending in the United States alone. “If Taylor Swift were an economy, she’d be bigger than 50 countries,” said Dan Fleetwood, President of QuestionPro Research and Insights, in a story for GlobalNewsWire. On the opening night in Glendale, Ariz., the concert brought in more revenue for local businesses than Super Bowl LVII, which was held back in February in the same stadium. To use that event as a comparison, Swift has been performing the equivalent of two to three Super Bowls every weekend for the past five months (and six of seven nights at her last round of shows in Los Angeles). The Illinois governor credited the musician with reviving the state’s tourism industry after her three nights in Chicago. She was even mentioned in a report by the Fed, crediting her with fueling the national tourism industry. 
        <br><br>The enthusiasm is so great that cities along her tour have experienced supply shortages. For one example: Swift mentions “friendship bracelets” in the song You’re on Your Own, Kid, off her most recent album Midnights. Swifties have taken this and run with it. Every concert is filled with tens of thousands of fans wearing and exchanging beaded bracelets spelling out the names of Swift songs and colloquialisms all the way up their arms. While this bracelet economy has brought new revenue to local businesses, businesses have also reported bead and sequin shortages.
        This enthusiasm comes despite broader economic challenges. “There’s a cost of living crisis and people are still forking out thousands of dollars to see Taylor Swift,” says Enders. Despite this, a national study of concertgoers shows that even with an average of more than $1,300 spent per event, 91% said they would go again.
        </p><br>
    <h3 style="color: white;">Cultural Impact :</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">Not only is the Eras Tour an economic boon, but it has also become a cultural phenomenon. Every city Swift has visited over the course of the tour so far has pulled out all of the stops for her: Minneapolis was renamed “Swiftie-apolis;” Santa Clara, Calif., made her the honorary mayor; the New Jersey governor named the state sandwich of New Jersey after her. Now world leaders like the Chilean President, the mayor of Budapest, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are asking her to bring the tour to their countries. The FBI tweeted out a Taylor Swift pun in July.
        <br><br>Princiotti says that in her role as a fan, it’s been both exciting and strange to see such a global embrace of Swift. “For as big as she has been for so long, even if this is a new peak, I think a lot of fans feel like they've spent their entire lives defending their love of her,” she says. “And there's something very strange in seeing the U.S. government, or all of these various municipalities, just desperate to get a little sliver of the clout that comes from just being somewhat associated with Taylor Swift.”
